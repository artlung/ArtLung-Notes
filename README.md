ArtLung Notes' idea is to be able to touch the screen, make a note, and be able to drag it around. It's also to have those notes be persistent.

The notes are persistent.

- v1 Uses jQuery
	- reads from php encoded json files
	- saves to php encoded json files

- v2 uses Sencha Touch/ExtJS
	- reads from php encoded json files
	- saves to php encoded json files
	- saves to window.localStorage
	- TODO: have it also read from localStorage

It's a work in progress and ideas are welcome.
